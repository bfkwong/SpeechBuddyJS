1) As an educator, I want the option to upload multiple papers of my students’ simultaneously when getting feedback, so that I can quickly go through my students’ papers.

2) As an educator, I want to verify my classroom is not plagiarizing their speeches by copying quotes or phrases from other speeches without citation, so that I can ensure original work from students in my class.

3) As an educator, I want to identify specific papers that are similar to analyze further, so that I can rapidly identify cheaters in my classroom.
