1) As a student, I want to compare similar speeches to mine to make sure I’m not plagiarizing and staying on topic, so that I can responsibly be inspired.

2) As an educator, I want to be alerted to specific sentences and phrases that have potential for plagiarism, so that I can quickly pinpoint academic dishonesty in my classroom.

3) As an educator, I want a numerical score of how similar certain sentences and papers are to each other, so that I can quantify the severity of my students’ plagiarism.
