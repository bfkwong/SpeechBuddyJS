1) As a speaker user, I want to speak into an application and have the application provide feedback to me about my speech, so that I can improve as a public speaker.

2) As a student user, I want to receive feedback on my grammar and word diversity, so that I can improve my speech skills.

3) As a social media user, I want to see the potential sentiment and toxicity my post may have, so that I can contribute positively on social media.
